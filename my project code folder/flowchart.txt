Notebook
----------
1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset - Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) Data 
3. Data processing & Data Cleaning
	- Using Keras MinMaxScaler
4. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Splitting the data to train and test
6. Building the model
    - LSTM
    - LSTM + CPD
    - Lasso Regression
    - Ridge Regression
    - XGBooster Regression
    - Voting Regression - (DT + RF + SVR)
    - MLP
    - RNN
    - CNN
    - Attention + CPD + LSTM
   7. Training the model
8. Building the model with LR gives better accuracy comparing with Other Models
Flask Framework
----------------
9. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
10. Importing the packages
11. User gives input as Symbol of cryptocurrency
12. The given input is preprocessed and the data regarding crypto is scraped based yahoo finance 
13. Then based on the input crypto the tweets are scraped  using tweepy
14. With all this information, the define LR, LSTM model and ARIMA is used for prediction
15. Final outcome is displayed through frontend
Extension
----------- 
In the base paper, the author mentioned to use Attention + CPD + LSTM, LSTM, LSTM + CPD for analysis Bitcoin data, in which we got MSE 0.3462 
As an extension we have applied CNN,RNN,MLP, Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, XGBoost and Voting Regression, in which we got Linear Regression 98.8% with 0.12 MSE Values
So Linear Regression, LSTM and ARIMA Model is used for dumping the model to predicting the result, Recommending and Forecast the Bitcoin Price.
